# Eircode-Scraper

##Status
This is working as of the 7/Feb/2016. As always with scraping this could easily break.

##About
A Python Script for Scraping Eircodes and Addresses. Running this script will allow you to slowly download the eircode database (randomly).

## Python Version
2.7.11 (v2.7.11:6d1b6a68f775, Dec  5 2015, 20:40:30) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)]

## Contents
1. main.py
2. eircode.csv

## Steps
1. Just run main.py (For example in linux run in the terminal "python main.py". Or just double-click it in Windows.)
2. A csv file will be created
3. The csv file will fill up with eircodes and addresses
4. It will take a while to get up to full speed (15 minutes)
5. It will average out at one eircode and one address per second at full speed
6. Enjoy :)
